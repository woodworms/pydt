# pydt

This is an excellent Python-binding for libfdt, designed for working with Flattened Device Tree (FDT). It allows users to interact with FDT using Python dictionaries, making it highly suitable for integration into a wide range of applications. This binding enables users to interact with device trees via libfdt without requiring knowledge of C language. Furthermore, it provides the capability to generate corresponding device tree source files through Python code, offering a straightforward approach for manipulating both device trees and their binary formats with ease.
